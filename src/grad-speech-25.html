<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Thank you, Gayle.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  Good evening. It&#8217;s my great honour and pleasure to speak to you on behalf of
the 2023 cohort.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >  I want to start with some thank-you&#8217;s. Firstly to Jane and Paul. Each person
in this cohort could speak at length to the difference this scholarship has made
to their lives and the opportunities is has enabled. I hope I am able to do this
tonight.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  To the Hansen staff, Gayle, Caesey and Cass: thank you. For myself and
many others, you were our first trusted adults in Melbourne and our first
mentors, role-models and advocates at university. The supportive community
you continue to build here could not be a better fit for what I wish for this
scholarship.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  I want to thank Little Hall staff, including the acting head Anthony, the
academic staff including Charlotte and Olivia, and all those who enable Little
Hall to excel in it&#8217;s academic services and social opportunities.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  I want to extend these thanks to past Hansen and Little Hall staff who have
been a part of this cohorts journey, including Josh.
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >  Lastly I want to thank you, the graduating scholars, for the friendships,
corridor-conversations and for being a constant in the rush of Melbourne life.
It has been a privilege to live with you all and it is inspiring to see
so many intelligent, mature and kind people all in one place. Thank
you.
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >_________________________________________________________________________
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  Giving back is one of the most important aspects and privileges of this
scholarship. When I was interviewing for this program I spent a lot of time
thinking about how I could give back. To me this meant mentoring
students in the mentoring program and during orientation and development
program events. But my conception of how to give back has changed since
then.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  When I think holistically about this program, and the study at this
institution that it allows, we all develop three things: education, maturity and
perspective. These traits form a strong basis with which you can change the
lives of others.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >  Creating this change doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean advocating on government
bodies (though some of you will do this), it can be more subtle. It can be the
language choices you make in water-cooler conversations. Or it can be the
example you set when you are given the privilege of teaching someone
else.

<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >  The people in my life that I look up to the most, the role-models I aspire to
emulate, are all emotionally intelligent, mature and thoughtful teachers who&#8217;s
understanding and perspectives of the world I hope to gain. They are teachers
who look-out, who&#8217;s conduct sets an example and who&#8217;s actions advocate for the
opportunities of their students.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >  I want to encourage you to think about the teachers you look up to the most,
to think about the ways in which you can emulate the example they set and to
think about how you can be an advocate for those facing barriers to tertiary
education.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >  However, implementing these things is no easy feat. The traits of these
teachers are evidently the result of deep thinking and reflection; art crafted over
many years.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >  For the 2022 and 2023 cohorts I encourage you all, when you get to teach, at
work, Uni or home, to dedicate time to think deeply about how you can
emulate your teachers and be an advocate. For the younger cohorts, I
encourage you to participate in mentoring and to get as much out of
this program that you can so you can learn the art of teaching and
advocacy.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >  The consequence, for all cohorts, of doing these things is the ability to change
the lives of others, as your teachers might have done for you and as this
program has done for us all. As Hansen scholars&#8212;educated, mature and
emotionally-intelligent young adults&#8212;you are all capable of becoming these
kinds of teachers.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >  Doing this, to me, is the ultimate way that we give back to this program&#8212;a
program which has given us so much.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >  The world is a better place when we give back. The world is a better place
because of you all, Jane and Paul.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >  Thank you. Goodnight.
